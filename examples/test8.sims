# Specifications
on_power := 10 [kW]
on_time := 3.3 [min]
off_time := 30 [min]

# A few constants
emiss := 0.7
sigma := 5.67e-8 [W/m^2/K^4]
T := 303.15 [K]
L := 222 [kJ/kg]

# Now the equations

# Total energy generated
energy = on_power*on_time
energy ~ 1000[kJ]

# We must be able to store this much energy at the end of the on time
(energy - radiation_power*on_time)  = heat_capacitor_mass * L

# Guessing the heat capacitor mass
heat_capacitor_mass ~ 10[kg]


# Radiation power is got by the stephan-boltzmann equation
radiation_power = emiss * area * sigma * pow(T, 4)

# Total radiation emergy outwards must be the energy generated
radiation_power * (on_time+off_time) = energy 

# Guessing the area required and the radiation power
area ~ 5 [m^2]
radiation_power ~ 5[W]

# Just print the per-area wattage of radiator
radiation_power_per_sqm = radiation_power/area

radiation_power_per_sqm ~ 300[W/m^2]
